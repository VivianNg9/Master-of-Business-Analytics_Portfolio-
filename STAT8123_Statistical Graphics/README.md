# __<center>Statistical Graphics</center>__
This course covers the principles of effective graphical presentation, blending historical context with modern multivariate techniques like trellis/lattice graphs and mosaic plots for diverse data displays and model analysis. It incorporates the use of R and other standard packages, allowing for personalized exploration in areas of interest. Suitable for any stage of a graduate program, the course serves both as an introductory and a comprehensive overview.
## __<center>Objectives</center>__
- Be familiar with important and contemporary examples of graphics, and be able to use them.
- Be aware of the elements of graphical design, and use them to critically appraise presented graphics in articles and web pages and suggest appropriate ways to improve them.
- Use the computer to generate appropriate graphics using particular packages or languages and be able to develop the ability to do so in others.
- Be familiar with a range of modern multivariate graphical techniques and know when it is appropriate to use them.
- Use statistical graphics to investigate and analyse data, check statistical model assumptions and effectively present the results of statistical investigations graphically to a range of audiences.

1. **Assignment 1**: Interpreting and Critiquing Statistical Graphics
- **File**: [`Assignment 1.pdf`](https://github.com/VivianNg9/Master-of-Business-Analytics_Portfolio-/blob/main/STAT8123_Statistical%20Graphics/Assignment%201.pdf)
- **Description**: This assignment is to collect, interpret, and critique five statistical graphics from specified sources. It requires that analysis should focus on critiquing and interpreting each graphic based on its design tools and principles, assessing both its strengths and weaknesses.

- **Description**:
  - Answering a series of research questions using R with the tidyverse commands.
  - Adhering to quality criteria like using tidyverse for data manipulation, crafting professional graphics with ggplot, and providing clear interpretations and written responses.
