# Assignment 2: Visualising Statistical Data

## Context
In Australia, the food industry is big business! Encompassing restaurant businesses and businesses that grow
and /or process food to sell to supermarkets and restaurants, the food industry is a significant contributor to the
economy. In 2018, the food industry contributed more than $187 billion towards Australia’s GDP.
Given the size and importance of the food industry, it is important to ensure that food is safe to eat. As such,
the food industry is carefully regulated with rules and procedures that provide minimum standards that
businesses must meet.
In New South Wales, the NSW Food Authority regulates and manages food safety
(https://www.foodauthority.nsw.gov.au/media/3196). Despite clear processes and procedures that inform
businesses of mandated standards (https://www.foodstandards.gov.au/code/Pages/default.aspx), some
businesses fail to abide by the rules. The NSW Food Authority publishes a list of the businesses that breach
the law in their Name and Shame list (https://www.foodauthority.nsw.gov.au/offences).
