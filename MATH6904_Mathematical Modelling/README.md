# __<center>Mathematical Modelling</center>__
This course covers algebra and calculus applications in economics, business, and finance, focusing on mathematical modeling and problem-solving techniques. It includes topics like linear systems, matrices, and optimization, with practical applications to real-world economic and financial scenarios.
## __<center>Objectives</center>__
- Develop of a range of algebraic skills and proficiency in algebraic techniques applicable to economics, finance and statistics.
- Demonstrate knowledge of linear equations and linear models to solve problems in economics, finance and statistics.
- Apply a wide range of techniques and ideas from differential and integral calculus to the analyse business, economic and financial data.
- Investigate a range of optimisation problems using the techniques of calculus.
- Formulate models of a variety of real world situations using techniques from differential equations.
